I am a passionate Analyst with an out-of-the-box mindset and hunger for growth. My career interests and experience are primarily focused on macroeconomics, corporate finance, quantitative finance and financial research. I am committed to unlocking as much value as possible across emerging markets and developing markets in Africa. I'm also an avid fan of sports, socializing and travel in my spare time.
