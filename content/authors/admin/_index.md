I'm a passionate Financial Economist working to better understand how macro trends influence capital markets and trade dynamics around the world. My fields of expertise include Macroeconomic & Thematic Research, Forecasting & Modelling, Financial Analysis and Data Visualisation. I thoroughly enjoys generating new ideas and devising feasible solutions to broadly relevant problems. I'm also an avid fan of sports, winetasting, politics and travel in my spare time.
